The current repository focuces on the Anomaly Transformer from a github page: https://github.com/thuml/Anomaly-Transformer

However, there are a few modifications to the solver.py file which now consists of some plotting scripts to see the actual anomalies.
The og_solver.py is the initial file without any changes to the source code.

To train the model you should set the "mode" in main.py to "train" and pick a dataset that you want to train the model on from this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gisthCoE-RrKJ0j3KPV7xiibhHWT9qRm
